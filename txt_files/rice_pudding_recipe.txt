Rice Pudding Recipe
Equipment:
▢ Large saucepan
Ingredients:
▢ 4½ cups whole milk (1,080mL)
▢ ¼ cup granulated sugar (50g)
▢ Pinch of salt
▢ ¾ cup uncooked white rice (short grain) (135g)
▢ ⅓ cup raisins (optional) (55g)
▢ 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
▢ Ground cinnamon
Instructions
• In a large saucepan, stir together the milk, sugar, and salt. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Stir in the rice.
• Reduce the heat to low, and partially cover. Simmer, stirring frequently, until the rice is tender and the mixture has thickened, about 25 to 30 minutes.
• Stir in the raisins if using, vanilla, and cinnamon to taste. Continue cooking until desired thickness. (Keep in mind the pudding will thicken as it cools. If it gets too thick for your liking, thin with a bit more milk.)
• Serve warm or let cool to room temperature, then refrigerate in an airtight container and serve cold. Top with extra cinnamon, if desired.
